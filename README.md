## About HearSee

HearSee is a powerful web application that combines vision AI and speech synthesis capabilities to provide an interactive experience for analyzing and discussing images with AI assistance. The application is built using Python with a Gradio-based web interface, leveraging state-of-the-art AI models through the Replicate API.

### Core Features

#### Vision AI Capabilities
- **Image Chat**: Upload images and have natural conversations about their content using the Qwen 2 VL 7B multimodal large language model
- **Text Extraction**: Extract and transcribe text visible in images
- **Image Captioning**: Generate detailed descriptions of image content
- **Image Summarization**: Get comprehensive contextual summaries of images

#### Voice AI Capabilities
- **Text-to-Speech**: Convert AI responses to natural-sounding speech using the Kokoro TTS model
- **Voice Selection**: Choose from multiple voice types (female and male voices with different accents)
- **Speed Control**: Adjust speech playback speed from 0.5x to 2.0x

#### User Interface
- **Chat Interface**: Intuitive chat interface with image upload capability
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time metrics showing latency and word count
- **Response Regeneration**: Option to regenerate AI responses
- **Image Gallery**: Display area for uploaded content

## Technical Architecture

HearSee follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Main Application (app.py)**: Entry point that initializes the Gradio interface
2. **Services**: Core functionality modules for image processing, API integration, and TTS
3. **UI Components**: Interface modules for chat, documentation, and reusable elements
4. **Utilities**: Helper functions for image operations, validation, and logging
5. **Configuration**: Settings, constants, and logging configuration
