Configuration settings for the HearSee application.

This module centralizes all constant values and configuration parameters used throughout
the application. It includes model identifiers, API settings, image processing limits,
initial chat history, and text-to-speech configuration.

Constants:
    QWEN_VL_MODEL (str): Replicate model identifier for the Qwen VL vision-language model
    KOKORO_TTS_MODEL (str): Replicate model identifier for the Kokoro text-to-speech model
    DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS (int): Default maximum token limit for API responses
    MAX_IMAGE_SIZE (int): Maximum allowed image size in bytes
    INIT_HISTORY (list): Initial conversation history for the chat interface
    VOICE_TYPES (dict): Mapping of human-readable voice names to voice IDs
    TTS_SPEED_RANGE (tuple): Minimum and maximum allowed speech speed values
    DEFAULT_VOICE (str): Default voice type for text-to-speech conversion
    DEFAULT_SPEED (float): Default speech speed for text-to-speech conversion
