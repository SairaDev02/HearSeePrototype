## 6. Advanced Usage

### 6.1 Optimizing Response Quality

#### 6.1.1 Crafting Effective Prompts

The quality of AI responses depends significantly on how you phrase your questions or prompts. Here are strategies for crafting effective prompts:

- **Be specific**: "What color is the car in the foreground?" is better than "Tell me about the car."
- **Provide context**: "This is a diagram of a solar system. Can you identify the planets?" helps the AI understand what it's looking at.
- **Use clear language**: Avoid ambiguous terms or complex sentence structures.
- **One question at a time**: For complex topics, break down your queries into individual questions.
- **Build on previous context**: Reference earlier parts of the conversation when relevant.

Examples of effective prompts:
- "Can you identify all the fruits visible in this image?"
- "What architectural style is this building, and what are its key features?"
- "Read the text on this sign and explain what it means."

> [!TIP]
> If you receive a response that doesn't fully address your question, try rephrasing or being more specific in your follow-up.

#### 6.1.2 Using Context Effectively

HearSee maintains context throughout a conversation, allowing for more natural interactions:

- **Reference previous messages**: You can say "Tell me more about that" or "Why is that significant?" and the AI will understand the reference.
- **Progressive exploration**: Start with general questions and then dive deeper into specific aspects.
- **Clarification requests**: If the AI misunderstands something, you can correct it: "No, I meant the red object in the corner."
- **Comparative questions**: Ask about relationships between elements: "How does the left side of the image differ from the right?"

### 6.2 Working with Complex Images

#### 6.2.1 Multi-object Images

Complex images with multiple objects present both challenges and opportunities:

- **Prioritize your focus**: Direct the AI's attention to specific areas or objects of interest.
- **Use spatial references**: "In the top-left corner" or "in the background" helps the AI focus on specific parts.
- **Ask about relationships**: "How are these objects arranged?" or "What's the relationship between the person and the dog?"
- **Request counting or enumeration**: "How many people are in this image?" or "List all the vehicles visible."

> [!NOTE]
> **Screenshot Placeholder**: *Example of a complex image with multiple objects and a conversation about specific elements.*

#### 6.2.2 Images with Text and Graphics

For images that combine text and visual elements (like infographics, slides, or annotated diagrams):

- **Separate text and visuals**: You can ask about the text content first, then the visual elements.
- **Request integration**: Ask how the text and visuals relate to each other.
- **Focus on data visualization**: For charts or graphs, ask about trends, comparisons, or key data points.
- **Check for consistency**: Ask if the text accurately describes or complements the visual elements.

### 6.3 Response Regeneration

#### 6.3.1 When to Regenerate Responses

The response regeneration feature allows you to get a new answer to the same question. This is useful when:

- The initial response contains inaccuracies
- You want a different perspective or approach
- The response is too brief or too detailed
- The AI misunderstood your question
- You want to see alternative interpretations of the image

To regenerate a response:
1. Click the "Regenerate Response" button after receiving an AI answer
2. Wait for the new response to be generated
3. Compare with the previous response

#### 6.3.2 Improving Results Through Iteration

Response regeneration can be used strategically to improve results:

- **Refine your understanding**: Compare multiple responses to get a more complete picture.
- **Verify information**: If you're unsure about a response, regenerating can help confirm details.
- **Explore alternatives**: Get different perspectives on subjective aspects of an image.
- **Educational use**: See how the AI might approach the same question in different ways.

> [!TIP]
> After regenerating, you can continue the conversation with either response in mind. The AI will maintain context from the most recent response.

### 6.4 Session Management

#### 6.4.1 Managing Conversation History

HearSee maintains your conversation history within a session:

- **Scrolling**: You can scroll up to review earlier parts of the conversation.
- **Context window**: The AI considers the recent conversation history when generating responses.
- **Memory limitations**: Very long conversations may exceed the AI's context window, causing it to forget earlier messages.

> [!NOTE]
> **Screenshot Placeholder**: *Conversation history showing multiple exchanges about an image.*

#### 6.4.2 Starting New Sessions

To start a new session:

1. Click the "Clear Chat" button to reset the conversation history
2. Upload a new image if desired
3. Begin a new conversation

Starting a new session is recommended when:
- Switching to a completely different topic
- Uploading a new image that's unrelated to the previous one
- The conversation has become very long
- You want to start fresh without previous context

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Clearing the chat will permanently delete the current conversation history. There is no way to recover cleared messages.

1. If a response appears to be cut off, simply reply with "please continue" or a similar phrase
2. The AI will generate the remainder of the response in a new message
3. For very long responses, you may need to request continuation multiple times
4. Consider breaking complex questions into smaller, more focused queries

> [!NOTE]
> This limitation is technical in nature and related to the API's design, not to the quality of your query or the AI's ability to respond completely.
