   # Include actual setup commands
   pip install gradio
   pip install [other dependencies]
   ```

2. **Application Initialization:**
   [Describe the initialization process]

### X.4.2 Gradio UI Implementation

The Gradio framework was selected for its simplicity in creating machine learning interfaces and its built-in sharing capabilities. The implementation includes:

**Local Application Launch:**

- Local file system integration for data processing

**Public Sharing Configuration:**
- Optional public sharing link generation using `share=True` parameter
- Secure tunnel creation through Gradio's infrastructure
- Temporary URL generation for demonstration and collaboration purposes

```python
# Example code snippet for Gradio setup
import gradio as gr

def launch_application():
    interface = gr.Interface(
        fn=main_processing_function,
        inputs=[...],
        outputs=[...],
        title="[Your Application Title]",
        description="[Brief description]"
    )
    
    # Launch with optional public sharing
    interface.launch(
        share=False,  # Set to True for public sharing
        server_name="0.0.0.0",
        server_port=7860
    )
```

        # Processing logic
        result = process_data(input_data)
        return result
        
    except ValueError as e:
        # Handle validation errors
        return {"error": str(e), "status": "validation_failed"}
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle unexpected errors
        return {"error": "Processing failed", "status": "error"}
```

            placeholder="Enter data here..."
        )
        submit_btn = gr.Button("Process")
    
    output_component = gr.Textbox(
        label="Results",
