## 1. Introduction to BERTScore and Visualization Context

BERTScore is a text evaluation metric that leverages contextual embeddings from transformer models like BERT and RoBERTa to compute semantic similarity between reference and candidate texts. Unlike traditional lexical metrics (BLEU, ROUGE), BERTScore captures deeper semantic relationships by measuring token-level similarities using cosine similarity between embeddings.

The visualizations analyzed in this document represent the results of benchmark tests conducted using the HearSee BERTScore Benchmarking Tool. This tool processes reference and candidate text pairs, computes BERTScore metrics (precision, recall, F1), and generates comprehensive visualizations to facilitate analysis and interpretation of the results. In this specific evaluation, Qwen 2 VL 7B (a 7 billion parameter multimodal model) outputs are being compared against Claude 4 Sonnet outputs, which serve as the reference or "frontier" standard.
